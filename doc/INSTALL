BC Post To View extension INSTALL

Installation
============

1. Getting eZ publish
   ------------------

   You can download a version of eZ publish from ez.no,
   you will find the various versions at:

   http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_4_stable_releases

   Note: You will require eZ publish 4.0.3 or higher

   Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
   
   http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/installation
   and
   http://ez.no/doc


2. Installing BC Post To View extension package
   ---------------------------------------------

   1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

   2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

   [Tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcposttoview.tar.gz

   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcposttoview.tar.zip


3. Activate BC Post To View extension
   -------------------------------------------

   We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   You must enable the bcposttoview extension *above*
   ezwebin design extension in order for all features to function properly.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcposttoview

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcposttoview
